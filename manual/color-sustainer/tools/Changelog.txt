1.05:

Resolved the following issues:

-Fixed profile parsing. Now all profiles that can be loaded into the graphics card (have a video card gamma table) work. Thanks to imyrno for the detailed steps for profile parsing.

-Fixed the memory leak that occurs when the application is started and looping.

-Fixed an update checking bug whereby newer versions yet unreleased to the public are not deemed newer than the latest version released.


1.04.2:

-Removed "by yasamoka" in title, "Donate" section under "Help", added "About Color Sustainer" section under "Help".

Resolved the following issues:

-Made the update system smarter; now it properly compares version numbers and does not only check for mismatch.

-The "Check for updates periodically" checkbox is unchecked if the settings window is shown, an update is available, and "Never remind me again" is pressed.

-Tray icon context menu now gets drawn upwards rather than downwards the first time the tray icon is right-clicked with the taskbar placed at the bottom.

-LUT Bit Depth Clamp now works for monitors in global color profile association mode.

-Start / Stop main window action button text now first shows "Stop" instead of "Start" if Color Sustainer is started via "-start" argument.

-The version field in the Settings file has to be at the top else loading the settings fails.

-An invalid settings keyword no longer causes settings loading to fail. (Useful for using older versions with settings files produced by newer versions)

-Changing one monitor from global to mode-specific color profile association mode then selecting a second monitor that is in global mode now clears the Resolutions list.

-Resolutions are now automatically detected after changing a monitor from global to mode-specific color profile association mode.

-Startup settings now get checked and updated upon application launch.

-Deleting a monitor in global color profile association mode now hides all the widgets related to associating a color profile / predefined tint.

-The README file now accomodates changes made since v1.04.1.


1.04.1:
-Emergency v1.04 hotfix


1.04:

Resolved the following issues:

-Color profile association section remains visible after a monitor in global mode is deleted

-Disabled buttons (greyed out) instead of hiding them

-Delete All Button gets disabled when there is nothing to delete

-Disabled the ability to resize windows (adds empty space)

-Tree no longer gets saved directly after being loaded (even successfully)

-Used a higher-resolution icon for the application windows

-Revamped the settings section

-Separated the tray icon modes from the application (going to be included in a sister application later on)

New features:
-Software update checking system
-Donate button


1.03.3:

Resolved the following issues:

-Debug line shows up in display list

-Log shows v1.03 at application launch

-Associating a new replacement color profile for an active display mode for an active monitor while the loop is running does not change the profile.

-Display Device Enumeration issue: on calling EnumDisplayDevices, assumed that only one display can be detected per device, used if statement instead of while loop


1.03.2:

Resolved the following issues:

-Removing a profile association from an active monitor in Global mode while the loop is running does not set the current profile to NULL.

-Setting a color profile (or changing from such color profile to a pre-defined tint) to an inactive mode for an active monitor in Mode-specific mode will set the current profile's ramp but not name to that color profile.

-Changed title to v1.03.2 (was 1.03 for v1.03.1)

1.03.1:

New feature:
-Change a monitor between Global mode / Mode-specific mode.


1.03:

Resolved the following issues:

-Display mode X is selected in the list and is the active display mode. Windows / external application changes the active mode. Now display mode X is not the active mode. Right-clicking on the already-selected display mode X does not show a "Change to Mode" option.

-Trying to associate a color profile that cannot be parsed results in logging "Failed to parse..." followed by "Associating color profile...". The (now null / random) gamma ramp then fails to load or be preserved.

-Color profiles now get closed after they are parsed (success / fail), instead of remaining open as long as Color Sustainer is running.

-Detect button shows for display mode and not for resolution when an inactive display is chosen

Changes:

-Log application launch

-Log success or failure for mode request changes

-Close to Tray instead of Minimize to Tray

-Tray icon now changes when started or stopped

-Added separate detect and delete options for monitors, resolutions, modes

New Feature:

-Tray Icon Display Modes: You can now add display modes to the tray icon, for quick switching between display modes straight from the tray. Right-click, hover over a monitor, and click on the display mode and the monitor should switch to that mode.
