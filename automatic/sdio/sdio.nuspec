        <description><![CDATA[# Snappy Driver Installer Origin (SDIO)

Snappy Driver Installer Origin is a fork of Snappy Driver Installer starting at version `r541`. The old project is no longer in the hands of the original developers, is no longer open source and is not safe to use.

Snappy Driver Installer Origin remains a free, open source project. Free means it costs you nothing to download and use. Free means it is free of adware, malware, backdoors, unwanted third party software or other dodgy stuff.

## INSTALL MISSING DRIVERS AND UPDATE OLD DRIVERS

If you've lost your driver discs, you're unable to find drivers on the manufacturer's website or Windows Update can't configure your hardware, use this tool to quickly find and install all missing drivers.

If you're a PC technician, keep Snappy Driver Installer Origin on your USB flash drive or external hard drive and take it with you wherever you go. In environments with no Internet access, you can quickly get things working. No more searching for drivers after a clean install, just let Snappy Driver Installer Origin do its thing and your job will be done in no time.
