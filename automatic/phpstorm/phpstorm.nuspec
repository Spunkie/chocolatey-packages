    <description><![CDATA[# PhpStorm Early Access Program
### What is Early Access Program?
We at JetBrains believe that making tools for developers should greatly involve _listening_ to developers. Our Early Access Program lets development community closely participate in discussions and influence product development planning, from early stages onwards.

Early Access Program allows you to try pre-release versions of our software to evaluate features that will be added in the next release.

**Be warned:** _It is important to distinguish EAP from traditional pre-release software. Please note that the quality of EAP versions may at times be way below even usual beta standards. If you are looking for a stable version, please, [visit our site](//jetbrains.com/phpstorm/download/)._

## PhpStorm FEATURES
PhpStorm is built on top of the open-source IntelliJ Platform, which we've been developing and perfecting for over 15 years. Enjoy the fine-tuned, highly customizable experience it provides to fit your workflow.
### Intelligent coding assistance
PhpStorm is a PHP IDE that actually 'gets' your code. It supports PHP 5.3/5.4/5.5/5.6/7.0/7.1, provides on-the-fly error prevention, best autocomplete &amp; code refactoring, zero config debugging, and an extended HTML, CSS, and JavaScript editor.
### Smart PHP Code Editor
The IDE provides smart code completion, syntax highlighting, extended code formatting configuration, on-the-fly error checking, code folding, supports language mixtures and more. Automated refactorings that treat your code with care, helping to make global project settings easily and safely.
### Code Quality Analysis
Hundreds of code inspections verify your code as you type and inspect the whole project for possible errors or code smells. Quick-fixes for most inspections make it easy to fix or improve the code instantly. Alt+Enter shows appropriate options for each inspection.
### Easy Code Navigation and Search
PhpStorm helps you get around your code more efficiently and save time when working with large projects. Jump to a method, function or variable definition in just one click, or search for its usages.
### HTML &amp; CSS Editor
All the cutting edge web development technologies are supported including HTML5, CSS, SASS/SCSS, LESS, CoffeeScript, ECMAScript Harmony, Jade/Pug, etc. Live Edit gives you an opportunity to see all the changes instantly in the browser without refreshing the page.
### JavaScript Editor
The smartest JavaScript Editor is bundled with the IDE, offering code completion, validation and quick fixes, refactoring, JSDoc type annotations support, JavaScript debugging and unit testing, support for JavaScript Frameworks, and more.
### Databases &amp; SQL
PhpStorm provides tools and code assistance features for working with databases and SQL in your projects. Connect to databases, edit schemas and table data, run queries, and even analyze schemas with UML diagrams. SQL code can be injected to other languages or edited in SQL Editor, with syntax highlighting, smart code completion, on-the-fly code analysis, code formatting and navigation available.
### Debugging
Zero-config debugging makes it really easy to debug your PHP applications. Besides, PhpStorm provides numerous options for debugging your PHP code with Visual Debugger, so you can: inspect variables and user-defined watches, set breakpoints and evaluate an expression in runtime, debug remote applications, debug a page in multiple sessions simultaneously, and more.
### Testing
You can develop PHPUnit tests right in PhpStorm and run them instantly from a directory, file or class, by using the context menu options. Code Coverage from PHPUnit shows how much of your code is covered with tests.
### Profiling
You can profile your applications with Xdebug/Zend Debugger and check aggregated reports in PhpStorm.
### Other Features
Perform many routine tasks right from the IDE with support for Vagrant support, Docker, Composer, VCS, and more.
